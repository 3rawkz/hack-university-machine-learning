# Intro

## What is Machine Learning?

- Artificial Intelligence?
- Modeling (Regression)?
- Prediction?
- Statistics?
- Data Science?
- [Setting up your environment](install.md)

## [Install Your Tools](install.md)
Learning vs teaching
   Feature engineering
Representation vs modeling
   Master Algorithm

Communication vs viz?


Useful to get a feel for where machine learning works and how well it works... The state of the art.

Examples
Brainstorm with students about ml in their lives
- did they ride public transport, use Google maps, wayze, or Evans ridereport app
- did they use their phone
  - login, wifi, autocomplete
interact with any websites?
  - purchases
  - analytics
  - advertisements

If you have somehow avoided it today, I'm going to inject some ml. Answer a poll for me so i can learn which lectures worked well and which didn't. Get andrew at harv.is to sponsor us?

Boots are already or companions. We are already cyborgs. So get to know your partner or you may lose control over your life to those pulling the puppet strings of the bots. Train them like you'd train your pet dog, or lizard
