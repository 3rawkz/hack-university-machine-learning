## Ideas

Ideas for HUML Class

- lecture on data, cleaning preprocessing, aquiring, project selection
- survey the class on operating system, language knowledge, math/education and start helping students build data set for predicting class performance
- live quizzes during class with [slack quizbot](https://github.com/codebyfire/slackquizbot)
- twitter bot to follow hashtags from the class and collate results from questions/topics
- get students to log a GPS track with MyTracks (or an iPhone app)
