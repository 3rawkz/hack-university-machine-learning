# Bots

## Dialog Engines

Machine Learning technology powers bots that are often so sophisticated they perform as well as humans at many dialog tasks.

  - LIZA: psychotherapist bot
  - "Magic.io"

MMORPG games and FPS games sometimes employ dialog engines to interact with players and "coach" them on community values, coerce people into behaving nicely. Often all it takes is a warning or reduction in score, or public shaming.

## Crawler

Crawlers are indexing the web perpetually and each bot has its own objectives. Often it is just to "index" URLs to allow subsequent revisiting for search query response.

In other cases crawlers are used to behave online like humans. They may be sussing out spammy links posted to forums.

Crawlers are often indexing you local hard drive to help you find files or even suggest actions, like archiving, cleaning up, etc. Your computer is watching, helping all the time.
