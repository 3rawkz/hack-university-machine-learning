## [Books](books.md)

This course will pull examples and ideas from multiple sources, but most closely resembles the content and structure of the second half of Grus's book Learning Data Science from Scratch from [O'Reilly $34](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do). Google "promo code O'Reilly" and you should be able to get 50% off.

Raschka book published by PackT ($35, but can sometimes get a promo code for 20% off)

## Some Thunder ;)

- [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/)
- [Data Science from Scratch]
Teaches stats with pandas and python. It has a github repo with notebooks to complete. Uses the author's libraries rather than more widely-used packages (e.g. scipy.stats).


- [Example ipython notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks) are some other notebooks I was using as models.
- [Unfinished example project](https://github.com/ThunderShiviah/data_science_notes/blob/master/notebooks/friend_paradox_unfinished.ipynb)
- [How to set up a pyspark vagrant box](https://gist.github.com/ThunderShiviah/f340d7fe50bb751d8516)
- [Jupyter's recommended stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) for Docker boxes
- Use [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/) instead of pip on Windows
