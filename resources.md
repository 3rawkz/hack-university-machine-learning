- [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/)
- [Data Science from Scratch]
Teaches stats with pandas and python. It has a github repo with notebooks to complete. Uses the author's libraries rather than more widely-used packages (e.g. scipy.stats).


- [Example ipython notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks) are some other notebooks I was using as models.
- [Unfinished example project](https://github.com/ThunderShiviah/data_science_notes/blob/master/notebooks/friend_paradox_unfinished.ipynb)
- [How to set up a pyspark vagrant box](https://gist.github.com/ThunderShiviah/f340d7fe50bb751d8516)
- [Jupyter's recommended stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) for Docker boxes
- Use [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/) instead of pip on Windows
