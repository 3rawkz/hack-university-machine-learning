This course will pull examples and ideas from multiple sources, but most closely resembles the content and structure of the Raschka book published by PackT ($35, but can sometimes get a promo code for 20% off)

### [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/)

Teaches stats with pandas and python. It has a github repo with notebooks to complete. Uses the author's libraries rather than more widely-used packages (e.g. scipy.stats).

* Learn data science from scratch: The book I was going to give every student as a reference/course guide. Builds up data science concepts in python by coding them from scratch rather than using pre-existing libraries.

* Here are some other notebooks I was using as models.

* Here's an (unfinished) example of what I wanted projects to look like.

For computer set up, I wanted everyone to use a virtual linux system (so I could teach command line tricks, viz Data Science at the Command Line).

I put up a gist talking about how to set up vagrant (my vagrant image is for pyspark so YMMV).

Even better is to use one of Jupyter's opinionated docker stacks.

Also I would recommend using conda instead of pip for package installation since you could then install anaconda which contains all the major scientific python packages and dependencies (makes installing jupyter notebook a breeze).
